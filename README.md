Design a simulator to emulate  a standard Turing Machine.  The input is  string placed on a “Tape” and a machine configuration file encoded in JSON formated text. Steps of our Program: Takes tape input and machine file path from user, Instantiates machine and tape, loads tape, then executes the machine and returns result of computation and trace
